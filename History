# Optimising-Sorting
Some attempts at optimising standard sorting codes
16/09/19
1 - Made initial sort() and swapSort() functions and tested them on a descending array from 10 to 1.

2 -swapSort was repeating for ever after completing swaps due to an error on while loop. Changed to while b true to fix this.
  -added in a Timer class which can be used to time how long sorts take. Unsurprisingly sort() was about twice as fast for this particular array.
